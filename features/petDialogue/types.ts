// AI Experience Phase 1: `DialogueCandidate` below is now a direct alias of
// the canonical `InsightCandidate` contract (see
// features/aiExperience/contracts/insightCandidate.ts) rather than its own
// interface. This is a type-only, additive change — every field this file
// used to declare directly is still present, verbatim, on `InsightCandidate`
// under its "legacy-compatible fields" heading, so resolveDialogue.ts,
// usePersonalizedPetDialogue.ts, and CatMascot.tsx all keep compiling and
// behaving identically. Only the candidate-building code in
// features/petDialogue/providers/*.ts was touched, to additionally populate
// the new canonical fields (`app`, `triggerId`, `facts`, `messageTemplate`,
// `sourceRecordId`, `evaluatedAt`).
