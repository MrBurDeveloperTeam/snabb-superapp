// Snabbb AI Experience — Phase 1 canonical candidate contract.
//
// This is the ONE deterministic candidate/fact shape intended to eventually
// feed three surfaces without duplicating business logic:
//   1. Cat Dialogue (the only active consumer today — see features/petDialogue)
//   2. Mini-App Landing Insight (not implemented in Phase 1)
//   3. Data-Driven Chat grounding context (not implemented in Phase 1)
//
// The one architectural requirement Phase 1 exists to satisfy: FACTS
// (structured, machine-readable) must be separate from the RENDERED MESSAGE
// (the exact string already shown to the user). `facts` + `messageTemplate`
// are the new, additive fields that make that separation real; `message`
// remains the byte-for-byte identical rendered string every provider already
// produced before this refactor.
//
// Design choice — additive, not a rewrite: every field the pre-Phase-1
// `DialogueCandidate` type had (userState, dialogueId, priority, message,
// action, source, dedupeKey, ruleVersion, bypassEntryWalk, autoCloseMs,
// eventTime, createdTime, recordId) is preserved verbatim below under a
// "legacy-compatible" heading. `features/petDialogue/types.ts`'s
// `DialogueCandidate` is now a direct alias of `InsightCandidate` — every
// existing consumer (resolveDialogue.ts, usePersonalizedPetDialogue.ts,
// CatMascot.tsx) keeps compiling and behaving identically without any
// changes on their end. Only the providers that BUILD candidates were
// touched, to additionally populate the new canonical fields.
//
// Two fields are intentionally duplicated with their legacy equivalent
// rather than replacing them, exactly per the allowance for temporary
// backward-compatible duplication:
//   - `sourceRecordId` (canonical) mirrors `recordId`/`source.recordId`
//     (legacy) — the legacy fields stay because resolveDialogue.ts's
//     tie-break reads `recordId` directly and must not be touched.
//   - `evaluatedAt` (canonical, top-level) mirrors `source.evaluatedAt`
//     (legacy) — both are set from the same single `new Date().toISOString()`
//     call per candidate build, so they can never drift apart.
// `app` (canonical) is also deliberately distinct from `source.app` (legacy)
// for two candidates where the underlying data-source label and the
// mini-app category differ on purpose — see InsightApp below.
